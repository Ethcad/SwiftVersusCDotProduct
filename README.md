# SwiftVersusCDotProduct
A benchmark developed for Xcode comparing the performance of the Swift standard library and a simple C function for computing the dot product of two single-precision vectors.

## Results
Tested on a Mid 2010 iMac with an Intel Core i5, this benchmark (over 100,000,000 iterations) took on average approximately 38 seconds under Swift and 40 seconds under C.
